# KTH_KeyChain
A simple PCB keychain about 4cm in diameter, designed in KiCad 9.0. 
I made it for my friends and myself to celebrate graduating with our Msc. degrees from KTH :)

I used Krita 5.2 to modify / create PNG images and used KiCad's image converter module to copy them into the PCB layout editor.

I used [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) to manufacture the PCB. They did an excellent job and I highly recommend them!
