# Graduation_KeyChain
A simple PCB keychain about 4 cm in diameter, designed in KiCad 9.0. 
I made it for my friends and myself to celebrate graduating with our Msc. degrees from KTH :)

I used Krita 5.2 to modify / create PNG images and used KiCad's image converter module to copy them into the PCB layout editor.

I used [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) to manufacture the PCB. The delivered product definitely met my expectations and I'm quite happy with it.
My original gerber submission was missing a layer. Their engineers were quick to point this out and helped me rectify the issue.
Their customer service was also quick and super helpful when it came to my questions about payment, shipping and even how much customs duties I should expect to pay.
All in all, I highly recommend them.

## Issues
1. One may notice a white border on the silkscreen in the design files. I mistakenly overlayed the silk screen border over the cutout border, which is why it looks a little distorted in the final manufactured product.
